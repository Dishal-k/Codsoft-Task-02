TIC-TAC-TOE Al

Task 02 : Implement an Al agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the Al player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

In this project, I've delved into the intriguing world of artificial intelligence, creating an AI agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a human opponent. I've implemented algorithms such as Minimax, with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to ensure that the AI player is unbeatable.
